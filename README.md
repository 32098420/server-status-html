server-status-html
==================
## Embed with iFrame
`<iframe src="http://example.com/serverstatus/status.html" width="600" height="120"></iframe>`

## Setup
Simply put the online img file on you're server from a public web folder, and change the URL(s) that look like `http://localhost:8080/online.png` and point it to the img file.

## Notes
It's not finished and not ready to use, but will be sometime soon.

I will work on making a improved script soon after this is finished.

It's best to have the status embed in an iframe!

## To do
*Cache refreshing*

*Cleanup the html*

*Improve looks for awesomeness*
